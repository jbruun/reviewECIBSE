Lamainalapates programme advocates an inquiry-based pedagogy which incites children to explore the world around them through observation and experimentation, to acquire scientific content knowledge, to reason and to master the use of language and argumentation.BREAK The French programme shares this broad definition of inquiry. The main goal is to contribute to the development of children’s curiosity, their creativity, their critical thinking and reasoning skills, and their mastery of language and argumentation, through science in school (see La main a` la paˆ te 2000; Saltiel 2006; Sarmant, Saltiel, and Le´ na 2011). La main a ` la pa ˆte promotes an open form of inquiry: under the teacher’s guidance, children are expected not only to carry out experiments, but also to raise research questions and to suggest possible ways of finding answers to those questions.
