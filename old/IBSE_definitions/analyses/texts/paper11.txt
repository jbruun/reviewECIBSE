The term inquiry is used to describe the processes and strategies of learning in any domain, but it can also include skills specific to a particular curricular area (Menmuir &Adams,1997).Processes and skills related to inquiry-based learning have often been studied inconjunction with mathematics and science in early childhood educational contexts (e.g. Epstein, 2007; French, 2004;Gerde, Schachter, & Wasik, 2013;Menmuir&Adams,1997). Early inquiry-based learning opportunities afford preschoolers the chance to build on theirinherent fascination with the functioning of the natural world through social collaborations in ‘experience-rich and language-rich environments’ (French, 2004, p. 147)BREAK . Thus, children do not just learn scientific facts from static, prescribed curriculum units, but instead learn to think like scientists by exploring big ideas and learning the language and practices of science (Gelman & Brenneman, 2012; Wasserman, 2015). In constructive, inquiry-based early childhood educational approaches to teaching science, children develop conceptual understanding and also practice using related skills and tools (French, 2004; Gelman et al., 2010; Greenfield et al., 2009; Inan et al., 2010). In addition, inquiry-based learning is cyclic. As children continue to develop knowledge, they seek new opportunities through which to apply their emergent scientific thinking and reasoning skills (Gelman & Brenneman, 2004). The process of inquiry also enables children to integrate language,literacy,math,and science educational experiences (Epstein, 2007; Gerde et al., 2013; Greenfield et al., 2009). Evidence and theory support the assumption that preschool children learn best when linking extant and new knowledge through hands-on experiences (Bjorklund, 2011; Gelman & Brenneman, 2012; Greenfield et al., 2009).
