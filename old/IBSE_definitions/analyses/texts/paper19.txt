In Phase 1, we predicted, by examining preschoolers’ questions and statements made about objects, confirmation of previous results (Greif et al., 2006) such that preschoolers, like adults, should hold different expectations about the type of information important for categorizing novel animals and inanimate artifacts. We also predicted that these information-seeking differences in preschoolers would appropriately extend, as with adults, to plants and mobile artifacts, given that this method arguably targets a more implicit awareness of the Living–nonliving kinds distinction by not relying on preschoolers’ explicit verbalization of this distinction. That is, preschoolers would want to know what an unfamiliar mobile artifact is used for yet would want to know about category membership, food choices, and typical locations for plants. Similarly, in Phase 2, we predicted, by examining what properties preschoolers attributed to the different objects, that we would confirm previous results (Backscheider et al., 1993; Inagaki & Hatano, 2002; Keil, 1992; Opfer & Gelman, 2001; Opfer & Siegler, 2004) such that preschoolers, like adults, would correctly distinguish living and nonliving kinds by selectively applying biological properties to animals and plants but not to mobile and immobile artifacts. In Phase 3, we targeted preschoolers’ and adults’ application of the concept ‘‘alive’’ to our four classes of stimuli and expected to confirm previous results that preschoolers, like adults, would overwhelmingly classify animals as living and immobile objects as nonliving (Opfer & Siegler, 2004). However, we predicted that preschoolers, in contrast to adults, would encounter more difficulty correctly assigning the word alive to plants but not to mobile artifacts (Carey, 1985; Hatano et al., 1993; Meunier & Cordier, 2004; Opfer & Siegler, 2004; Richards & Siegler, 1984; Waxman, 2005).
