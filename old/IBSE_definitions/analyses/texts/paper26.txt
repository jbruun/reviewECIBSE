Learning was therefore seen as a socio-cognitive process, resembling that used by scientists in scientific communities, to pose questions and problems, formulate hypotheses, design, collect and analyse data, experiences and observations, formulate conclusions and construct or reconstruct theories. Within inquiry-based learning, emphasis may be placed on processes of investigation (for example, Gott and Duggan 1995, Etkina and Van Heuvelen 2007), problem-solving (for example, Blum and Niss 1991, Erickson 1999, Lubienski 1999) and modelling (for example, Constantinou 1999, English 2003, Lesh and Lehrer 2003, Louca and Zacharia 2012) as a means for supporting children to construct nuanced meanings of the world that surrounds them.BREAK Even though inquiry-based learning, as a generic epistemological basis, informed the broader project and the CPD programme, at no point did the facilitators impose this idea on the participants.BREAK As children were now expected to engage with mathematics and science inquiry in epistemologically similar ways to those used by scientists, so were teachers engaged in this process, by inquiring and researching their own practice. This seemed to be strongly associated with a change in how they viewed children and teaching.
