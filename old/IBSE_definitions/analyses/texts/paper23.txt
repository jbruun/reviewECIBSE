This initial level reflects a strong naïve realism: Inquiry consists simply of “making observations about the world, either looking carefully at things or trying to see what happens” (p. 141).

This initial level reflects a strong naïve realism: Inquiry consists simply of “making observations about the world, either looking carefully at things or trying to see what happens” (p. 141). Most of their secondary school students manifested the subsequent relation-based reasoning level, in which, in a significant step away from the phenomenology itself, inquiry is conceptualized in terms of relations between variables.However, Driver et al.’s finer grained specification of relation-based reasoning reflects multiple vestiges of a naïve realism; in particular, relations are framed in terms of observable features that are “taken-for-granted as existing in the material world” (p. 115) and students assume a one-to-one correspondence between material world and causal factor (p. 115). Only a small minority of their 16-year-olds exhibited model-based reasoning, conceptualizing inquiry in terms of models of “provisional status” that do not “arise directly from the data” but consist of “coherent stories” based on “posited theoretical entities” involving “imagination and conjecture.” Consider the construct of“model.”As elaborated in the theoretical and instructional design work of Lehrer and Schauble (2000), it has many forms: from physical models, representational models, or syntactic (or analogical) models to hypothetical-deductive models BREAK These children had a strong motivation to be engaged in their investigations and subsequently the interview questions as they focused on the adequacy of their study as an instrument for addressing their question.
