This approach has often been described as inquiry-based teaching, or science as inquiry, and includes students drawing upon their scientific knowledge to ask scientifically oriented questions, collect and analyze evidence from scientific investigations, develop explanations of scientific phenomena, and communicate those explanations with their teacher and peers (NRC, 1996___2007). Inquiry has been defined in a number of ways, ranging from simple descriptions of students actively guiding their own learning with the teacher acting as facilitator to more elaborated lists of actions for the teacher, student, and curriculum (e.g., NRC, 1996, 2001)
