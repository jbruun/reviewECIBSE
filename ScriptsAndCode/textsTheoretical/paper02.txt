In the elementary schools in our university/school partnerships, we sought to begin this path to understanding the scientific practices by formally introducing the practices of observation, inference and evidence. Empirical evidence refers to qualitative and quantitative data used to develop and confirm scientific ideas. These empirical data are derived from observation using the five senses and scientific inferences which are logical interpretations based on these observations and prior knowledge. Science education research has shown that young children can attain informed formal understandings of these specific practices, and has provided teachers with specific pedagogical strategies that enhance that attainment AkersonVolrich2006; KhishfeAbd-El-Khalick2002; Metz2004.  BREAK The term practices is used throughout the documents to refer to the activities of scientists that are done repeatedly with increasing levels of proficiency Bybee2011; Michaels-etal2008. By repeatedly engaging in the practices of science, students  form an understanding of the crosscutting concepts and disciplinary ideas of science and engineering; moreover, it makes students knowledge more meaningful and embeds it more deeply into their worldview  NRC2012p42.
