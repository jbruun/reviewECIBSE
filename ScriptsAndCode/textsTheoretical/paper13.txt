Scientific process skills are essential skills that every individual should have in order to become a science literate. The best time to introduce children to science is the preschool period when they start to get curious about the world surrounding them. When children have the ability to use their scientific process skills, it is easier for them to reach new knowledge through concrete experiences and gain such knowledge HarlenQualter2004.  BREAK _According to Cepni-etal2006, those skills are divided into three groups: basic skills, causal skills, and experimental skills. Among those skills, basic scientific process skills are gained since birth. The most frequently repeated basic scientific process skills are observation, estimation, classification, using numbers, communication, measurement, data recording, problem solving, and reasoning skills HoweJones1998. Hypothesizing, defining hypothesis, and data checking skills are more advanced level scientific process skills that develop after preschool periods Lind2000. According to Kefi-etal2013, it is not possible to gain the scientific process skills, which are expected to be gained in further ages, effectively without developing the basic scientific process skills.  BREAK  SIP which are presented as follow: i  Understand science as a process of inquiry is based on asking questions and making predictions about the natural world;  ii  Understand the empirical basis of science: Scientific ideas are evaluated by their correspondence or fit to empirical evidence;  and iii  Understand simple tools used to gather, record, analyze, and share data.
