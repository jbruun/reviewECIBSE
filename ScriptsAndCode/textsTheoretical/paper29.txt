The SLP program of science instruction is grounded in design principles for inquiry-based pedagogy, as recommended by a national panel of experts and summarized by Duschl and Grandy2008.These design principles include the integration of the cognitive science concepts and scientific inference processes, epistemic knowledge validation and evaluation, and social understanding the sociocultural norms and practices of science dimensions in extended inquiry units  BREAK there is a general agreement that science comprises sets of sociocultural practices that enable members of the scientific community to co-construct, evaluate, and revise shared knowledge. These scholars also agree that developing shared norms for representing and evaluating empirical data plays a key role in the epistemic regulation of science.  BREAK we regard science as the collective processes of articulating, testing, evaluating, and refining or revising models of the world. We posit that inquiry is shaped by the unique content of the specific models constructed in different disciplines including theoretical models, as well as data and investigation models ChinnSamarapungavan2008; Suppes19601962; Woodward1989. SLP places no emphasis on students acquiring certain traditional vocabulary terms with regard to scientific inquiry such as  theories,   laws,  or  hypotheses  in light of the ongoing debates about the meaning and utility of these terms in the history and philosophy of science Cartwright19831999; Giere1988;Kuhn1962; Laudan1990. As elaborated in prior publications, the SLP starts with the premise that science can be viewed as a community of practice that shares key cognitive resources such as problem spaces, representational conventions, and knowledge of important domain models, techniques for collecting and analyzing data, and epistemic norms and criteria for evaluating knowledge Samarapungavan-etal20082009.  BREAK A key feature of pre-inquiry activities is that they are designed to provide children with entry points into the processes of science learning by drawing on their everyday experiences and ideas.  BREAK Post inquiry activities typically consisted of whole class presentations and discussions in which children reviewed and shared what they had learned with each other
