Most of their secondary school students manifested the subsequent relation-based reasoning level, in which, in a significant step away from the phenomenology itself, inquiry is conceptualized in terms of relations between variables. However, Driver-etals finer grained specification of relation-based reasoning reflects multiple vestiges of a naïve realism; in particular, relations are framed in terms of observable features that are  taken-for-granted as existing in the material world  p115 and students assume a one-to-one correspondence between material world and causal factor p115. Only a small minority of their 16-year-olds exhibited model-based reasoning, conceptualizing inquiry in terms of models of  provisional status  that do not  arise directly from the data  but consist of  coherent stories  based on  posited theoretical entities  involving  imagination and conjecture.  Consider the construct of model. As elaborated in the theoretical and instructional design work of LehrerSchauble2000, it has many forms: from physical models, representational models, or syntactic or analogical models to hypothetical-deductive models  BREAK These children had a strong motivation to be engaged in their investigations and subsequently the interview questions as they focused on the adequacy of their study as an instrument for addressing their question.
