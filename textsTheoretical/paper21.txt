In this paper, we focus primarily on scientific and engineering practices, which build from NSES science as inquiry standards. They incorporate engineering problems and focus more on the importance of developing and using models than prior standards. They include asking questions and defining problems, developing and using models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data,using mathematics and computational thinking, constructing explanations and designing solutions, engaging in argument from evidence and obtaining, and evaluating and communicating information  BREAK Other practices, such as supporting claims with evidence and analyzing data, are less frequently observed in primary classrooms Fulp2002; Trygstad-etal2013
