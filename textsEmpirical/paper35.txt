Then, kids would be divided into groups to search out possible answers, based_on the procedures presented in Table 1. Another example was the lesson  Finding partners (pretty gloves)  for ages of 4_5, which focused on  odd and even numbers . Real life objects were drawn into this lesson (e.g. chopsticks, gloves, and socks without right left distinction); hands_on activities were provided as well.
