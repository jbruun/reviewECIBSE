The coding scheme for inquiry was based_on prior research in preschool settings and included frequency counts of the following codes: observe question, plan predict, experiment evaluate, and conclude (French2004; McClain2014; VandermaasPeelerMcClain2016). Definitions, examples, and frequencies are presented in Table 1. For further analyses, inquiry was parsed into basic inquiry (observe question) and advanced inquiry (plan predict, experiment evaluate, and conclude). Chi_squared analyses were conducted to determine the significance of childrens age and type of activity on the frequency of observed inquiry processes. The Fisher_Freeman_Halton Exact Test (FET) was used for smaller data samples in which there were low frequencies in at least one column in the table (MehtaPatel1986). BREAK projects based_on childrens interests, foster the communitys engagement in childrens play and exploration through parents  involvement in education decisions and teachers  focus on research, and utilize the environment, the physical space and the community, as a third teacher (Edwardsetal2011; Inanetal2010) BREAK observing and questioning, young children learn to investigate and use evidence to evaluate information, social collaboration, coconstruction of meaning with supportive teacher guidance, the world around them, , they use open_ended questions to encourage childrens inquisitiveness, exploration, and problem_solving, four units of  reflect and ask,  plan and predict,  act and observe, and  report and reflect. BREAK play, nature awareness, construction, and expression. Examples of nature awareness included gardening and science experiments. Construction events included building with blocks and playing in a sand construction area outdoors. Expression events included drawing, painting, and making wood sculptures
