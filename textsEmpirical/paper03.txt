IBSE baseline unit. All teachers across the four conditions implemented the same IBSE baseline unit that required one lesson of 45_minute and four lessons of 90_minute. It was adapted from an empirically evaluated primary school unit on floating and sinking (e.g., Hardyetal2006; MoellerJonenHardyStern2002). Regarding the cognitive dimension of inquiry, each of the four lessons covered conceptual, epistemic, and social aspects, starting with a research question and a collection of students  hypotheses. To standardize the material for students  hands_on activities and teacher demonstrations, teachers were provided with a box that contained all of the objects needed for demonstrating empirical evidence (e.g., objects of steel, styrofoam, or wax; see MoellerJonen2005). All teachers were also provided with worksheets in which the basic concepts were applied to similar contexts. For each task, teachers could use worksheets appropriate for three different levels of conceptual understanding (basic repetition tasks, consolidation tasks, and complex transfer tasks). To further standardize the unit, all teachers were provided with a detailed manual that included prestructured lessons with detailed lesson plans and the learning goals of the four lessons. The unit was structured with regard to the content of investigation, moving from concepts of material kind and simple density to the relative density of water compared with the density of objects.
