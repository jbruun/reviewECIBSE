These skills are supported by the daily use of a science cycle, which is comprised of four steps: Step1, Reflect and Ask, typically takes place during a Circle Time activity in which the teacher introduces the science topic for the day through a demonstration, discussion, and related fiction or non-fiction book reading. Step2, Plan and Predict, occurs as the teacher introduces children to the science activity of the day and asks them to plan how they will conduct the activity and to predict the outcome. In Step3, Act and Observe, children take part in small group science activities where they engage in hands-on exploration and manipulation. Teachers are encouraged to  wrap language around activities  to facilitate childrens ability to map their mental representations of the science concepts onto language. Step4, Report and Reflect, typically takes place at the end of the day, when children communicate their findings in the form of an experience chart, drawing, or verbal report. This structured science cycle allows the teacher to model and support childrens use of the language and thinking processes associated with scientific inquiry.
