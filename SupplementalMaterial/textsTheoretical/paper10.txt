FSLs ultimate goal is to build preschool childrens ability to engage in inquiry and use inquiry skills such as exploring, asking questions, making predictions, investigating, observing, collecting and recording data, and generating and reflecting on their science ideas.  BREAK The pedagogical tools introduced in FSL include the inquiry learning cycle, the open/focused exploration framework, the engage–explore–reflect E-E-R cycle, and a set of Talk Tips. The inquiry learning cycle, as depicted in Figure 1, illustrates the nature of inquiry as both an iterative process and a set of skills. It reminds teachers that science inquiry for children is not a linear, step-by-step process but a spiraling, dynamic one. The open/focused exploration framework integrates two key ideas: a Opportunities for unstructured play with objects and materials are a prerequisite to jumpstarting the inquiry process; and b more focused, structured investigations build on early experiences and provide a context for more specific questions. This framework reminds teachers that they can promote conceptual development during a long-term study by providing children with initial open and then progressively more focused explorations that are responsive to childrens prior experience, interests, and questions. The E-E-R cycle is the central pedagogical tool of FSL and can be regarded as a simplified version of the inquiry learning cycle shown in Figure 1. It is an adaptable model that teachers can use to support iterative cycles of inquiry throughout the study of a topic during both open and focused explorations. E-E-R contextualizes inquiry and supports teachers efforts to draw out childrens prior knowledge and invite predictions engage; encourage childrens direct investigation, observation, and data collection explore; and help children reflect on their observations and share their evidence based ideas reflect. This cycle is explicated further in an upcoming section.
