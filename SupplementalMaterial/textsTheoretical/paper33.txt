Their problem solving and critical thinking skills flourish with this approach.  BREAK Phase1.  The purpose of Phase1 is to identify the topic by having young investigators figure out what they want to know HelmKatz2011. Ideally, it is the children that initiate the project idea; however, due to the nature and time constraints of the mini project, I introduced the topic of rain based on the unit on weather. For Phase1, we created a class web where I extracted their prior knowledge about rain and where it comes from. Afterwards, we explored three different books about rain and weather to expand our knowledge and gather more information. We then returned to the web and added to what we knew about rain  BREAK The purpose of Phase2 is to investigate the topic with in-depth study of the questions posed in Phase1 through hands-on experiences HelmKatz2011. In this phase, the children learned to gather data over a two-week span for our rain measure experiment, exploring mathematic skills. They also performed a rain simulation experiment and referenced secondary resources for more information working on scientific inquiry. The children continued to showcase their knowledge through reflective writings and discussions.  BREAK The purpose of Phase3 is to wrap up the project in a culminating activity and to share with others what they have learned HelmKatz2011.
