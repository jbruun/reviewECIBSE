Three of the features concern the interface of content and process: a immersion within strategically selected scientific domains; b centrality of big ideas in the practices; and c entwining of content and process. The next three features concern issues of motivation and goal structure: a centrality of curiosity as a drive for the enterprise of science; b discovery and explanation as toplevel goals, processes such as observation and categorization function only as subgoals; and c the challenge and delight of structuring the ill-structured. The last is a single feature, albeit connected with all of those before: a the social nature of scientific knowledge building practices  BREAK Discovery and Explanation as Top Level Goals, Processes Such as Observation and Categorization as Subgoals  BREAK The purpose of this initial scientific inquiry thought is epistemic, intended to introduce children to the enterprise of scientific inquiry while also serving as an early embedded assessment. I designed the thought experiment to fit Mayr1997 description of the most fundamental elements of inquiry:  an unexplained irregularity or anomaly  that arises from simple observation; a  puzzle  that emerges from this discovery; conjectures or hypotheses to explain the puzzle, and the testing thereof  BREAK  inquiry consists simply of  making observations about the world, either looking carefully at things or trying to see what happens  Driver-etal.
