We chose the topic of electricity to contextualize the planned scientific inquiry for essentially two reasons. The first was because it is a topic of the primary education science curriculum in Spain. 2 Thus, in the block denominated Matter and Energy, the following standard of learning is established (p19370):To know the basic laws governing such phenomena as the [] transmission of electric current. Also, in the block denominated Technology, Objects, and Machines (p19371): To observe and identify the elements of an electrical circuit, and construct one To observe, identify, and explain some effects of electricity To give examples of conducting and insulating materials, explaining the choice BREAK The study was specifically aimed at descriptively and interpretively analyzing PPTs skills in formulating a hypothesis to orient the inquiry, preparing a plan to test the hypothesis (experimental design, observation, and data acquisition), advancing the inferences expected from the planned observation, and pre-establishing a strategy with which to draw a conclusion from the inquiry.
