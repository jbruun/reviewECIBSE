Classes having received two different forms of support were regrouped here, for in both cases, support was long and discontinuous: teachers were supported for one whole year, but only through a few sessions of in_class support and a few meetings outside of class throughout the year. These two forms of support occurred in particular contexts. In centre  , experienced teachers were relieved of their teaching responsibilities for 1 day each week in order to support colleagues from neighbouring schools. Their purpose was to help their colleagues to implement a module through co_teaching, distributing and lending pedagogical documents and materials, organising short, half_day training sessions on a particular science subject on the syllabus. These teachers worked mainly by responding to their colleagues  specific requests. In centre (6), a scientific project on a cross_topic subject (i.e. scientific inquiry, writing in science class) was launched each year. Teachers were asked to tackle three different topics each year. Engagement in the project was voluntary. Teachers who enrolled in the project received in_class support from the pilot centre trainer for two Figure 2.

For each topic, two meetings among participant teachers and the trainer were organised (one before engaging the topic with the pupils, the other after having finished the topic), and the necessary pedagogical documents and materials were provided by the centre. Table 7 shows the results obtained by the classes in our sample which received long and discontinuous support with pedagogical emphasis, provided by an experienced teacher in centre   or by a teacher trainer in the framework of a science project in centre (6).
