In this program, inquiry learning has priority, the development of creativity is in the forefront, and the use of daily life experiences and immediate surrounding opportunities for education purposes is promoted (MNE2013). Moreover, in this program, learning centers in the classroom are important, cultural and universal values are taken into account, family education and participation are essential, and the assessment process is versatile. BREAK According to Cepnietal2006, those skills are divided into three groups: basic skills, causal skills, and experimental skills. Among those skills, basic scientific process skills are gained since birth. The most frequently repeated basic scientific process skills are observation, estimation, classification, using numbers, communication, measurement, data recording, problem_solving, and reasoning skills (HoweJones1998). Hypothesizing, defining hypothesis, and data checking skills are more advanced level scientific process skills that develop after preschool periods (Lind2000). According to Kefietal2013, it is not possible to gain the scientific process skills, which are expected to be gained in further ages, effectively without developing the basic scientific process skills
