Indeed, children develop understandings through their experiences in the world, and appropriate science teaching that uses their abilities to reason, conceptions of cause and effect, abilities to understand modeling, abilities to consider ideas and beliefs, and their eagerness to learn, has much potential to help them improve their understandings of science concepts (MichaelsShouseSchweingruber2008). BREAK  In that study, conducted in a six_week informal science education program in a large midwestern university, the instructors were able to focus specifically on the aspects of the nature of science. Their instructional unit included  introducing the aspects of the nature of science through decontextualized activities,  embedding these aspects into science content through contextualized activities,  using childrens literature,  debriefings and embedded assessments,   guided and student_designed inquiries. The focus of these strategies was on empirical, creative, tentative but robust, and subjective nature of science, as well as to help the students distinguish between observation and inference. BREAK Day Learning Goals The first_grade African_American girls will Activity distinguish the difference between an observation and an inference. Read book Seven_Blind_Mice (Young1992) Students are introduced to scientific journaling and draw a picture of themselves on the cover Read book What_Do_you_do_with_a_Tail_Like_This? (JenkinsPage2003) discuss the 5 senses as related to observation skills distinguish between observation and inference Discussion about books from Day 1 and how scientists use 5 senses during observations Draw a scientist activity (LedermanAbdElKhalick1998) Dog among spots activity (LedermanAbdEl_Khalick1998) Old Woman Young Woman activity (LedermanAbdElKhalick1998) Tricky Tracks Activity (LedermanAbdElKhalick1998)understand how to predict make observations and inferences Discussion about scientists drawings Opposite_Cube_Activity (LedermanAbdElKhalick1998) Read Dr_Xargles_Book_of_Earthlets (Willis2002) understand how to predict make observations and inferences Cube Activity (LedermanAbdElKhalick1998) Think Tubes (LedermanAbdElKhalick1998) understand how scientists infer about dinosaurs understand how scientists made predictions based_on their observation Read The_Dinosaur_Alphabet_Book (Pallota1990) Living vs. Nonliving students sort common items into living vs. nonliving sections make observations Read A_Mealworms_Life (Himmelman2001) Draw pictures of mealworm Observe mealworms Rework drawings of mealworms  understand how to make inferences understand how scientists collect data Read The_Extinct_Alphabet_Book (Pallotta1993) Draw pictures of why the dinosaurs became extinct Made fossils out of play_dough understand the difference between solids, liquids, and gases use their observations to categorize items The girls made observations about different common objects and categorized them into solids, liquids, and gases based_on their observations make observations and inferences and categorize data based_on it. Read Batholomew_and_the_Oobleck (Suess1949) Oobleck Activity (SneiderBeals2004) make changes to previous inferences based_on new data  make observations and inferences Sinking vs. floating_ students experimented with cubes made of different materials explore their own initial ideas of plants and develop questions demonstrate a basic understanding of variables and controls create their own experiment Students draw a picture of a plant and infer what it needs to grow Discussion of what plants need to grow Discussion of variables to figure out what plants need to grow understand what plants need to grow understand how scientists collect data Students set up plant (flowers) experiment with three variables collect data observe and infer improve their initial understandings of plants in light of new evidence Students draw observations of plant experiment Students observe and infer about different types of seeds Students plant lima beans hydroponically collect data observe and infer Students draw observations of flower experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants collect data observe and infer Students draw observations of flower experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants Students draw observations of lima bean experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants collect data observe and infer Students draw observations of flower experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants Students draw observations of lima bean experiment and make inferences about the needs of plant describe how a culture different from their own views planting and plant growth collect data observe and infer Read Bringing_the_Rain_to_Kapita_Plain (Aardema1992) Students draw observations of flower experiment Students draw observations of lima bean experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants describe Carvers studies on planting  collect data observe and infer Introduce George_Washington_Carver and his inquiries on soil and purpose of soil Plant peanut plants Students draw observations of flower experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants Students draw observations of lima bean experiment and make inferences about the needs of plants draw conclusions based_on observations and inferences Introduce McClintocks observations and inferences Students find the patterns on corn cobs Students draw conclusions about flower and lima beans based in their observations and inferences  collect data observe and infer Students draw observations of peanut plants and make inferences about the needs of peanut plants make conclusions based_on observations and inferences Students make conclusions about peanut plants based_on their observations and inferences
