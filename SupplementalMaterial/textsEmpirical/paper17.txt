In the current research project, we therefore investigated the effects of a curriculum on the topic of  floating and sinking  on young childrens conceptual knowledge as one way of implementing a structured inquiry_based curriculum that includes scaffolding elements in the early years of schooling, additionally differentiating between effects for children in preschool age (children 4_6 years of age) and children in early elementary school age (children 6_8 years of age). This topic was chosen because of four reasons: (a) its exemplarity in science concerning the core concept of material kind, (b) its potential to provide a framework for first experiences in methods of scientific inquiry, (c) its compatibility with concepts that are acquired later in the curriculum thus allowing for a learning progression over several years, and (d) its closeness to childrens everyday experience, thus promoting motivation and interest in science. BREAK 5E For the learning environment, the classes were provided with learning material consisting of a total of four work stations and a water tub. The material of the four sequences of learning activities was organized according to a presumed conceptual progression of three steps (see Table2 for a detailed description of the learning environment). First, childrens most frequent naive concepts with respect to predicting floating and sinking such as weight, volume, and shape were elicited. In a second step, the aim was to stimulate conceptual restructuring toward the inclusion of material kind in childrens prediction of an objects floating or sinking. The last step was aimed at restructuring the concept of material kind toward an initial concept of buoyancy in childrens explanations of floating and sinking. In all learning activities, scientific reasoning was promoted by contrasting material of different shapes, weight, or size, thus prompting comparison processes.
